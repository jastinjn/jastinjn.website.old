                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    In <i>Reload Tank!</i>, players take on the role of a loader in a main battle tank. On each mission, the player's vehicle encounters a variety of 
                    enemy forces. The player must identify, select and load the correct type of ammunition in order to survive each mission. 
                    Between missions, players can repair their tank's armor, purchase munitions and view intel for the next operation.
                    Once your tank take three direct hits, its all over!

                <h3>Art and Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    In designing this game's art, I attempted to replicate the look of an original Game Boy game played on a Game Boy Pocket. 
                    All the art is drawn with only 4 colors (5, if transparency is counted) which are varying shades of grayish green. Despite
                    the limited palette, the sprites came out rather clean. Fonts commonly used on early Game Boy games were used for certain text elements as well.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Sprite Sheet for Reload Tank</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Like the art, I also chose to follow an 8-bit audio design style. A majority of the SFX found in the game are taken from free use libraries.
                    To create the drum pattern in the opening and the song in the ending, I used the program famitracker, which is an audio tracker software used to 
                    create music that can be played on an actual Famicon console. Certain audio bits were also highly compressed to create a scratchy retro audio playback.

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my first original project created using Gamemaker Studio 2. Almost all the code is entirely mine, though some scripts
                    were borrowed from the great tutorial series by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn7FE3Tx391g1tWPv-1tv7Q">Shawn Spalding</a>. 
                    Basic gamemaker language concepts are used in this game, including collision detection, 2D arrays and camera movement.
