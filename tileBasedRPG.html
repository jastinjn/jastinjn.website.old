                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was ment to be a tile-based strategy RPG similar to games such as Intelligent System's <i>Fire Emblem</i> and <i>Advanced Wars</i> series.
                    Players take control of characters on a grid-based map and must defeat all enemies to complete each level. Each character has unique weapons and abilities.
                    Despite working on this project for several months, I abandoned it as I did not have the time and experience at that point to get it into a playable state.
                </p>

                <h3>Art and Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    Though this project was abandoned before completion, I actually created large amount of visual assets for this projects. This includes animated sprites for 4 playable characters,
                    two male, one female, and a cat, as well as for an enemy wolf and soldier. This was the first project I attempted to create tilesets to make environments. Despite the challenge, I believe
                    they came out very beautiful. <a href = "images/GameAssets/tilesetexample.png">Here</a> is an example of the types of environments that can be drawn using the grass, canyon, river and beach 
                    tilesets I created. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The visual style of game is inspired by the <i>Fire Emblem</i> titles that appeared on the Game Boy Advanced system. The game has an identical resolution to the GBA screen and features and extensive
                    color palette that makes the sprites really stand out. I am most proud of my work on the characters, which I drew as original works.

                    Due to the early abandonment of this project, I made no effort on including any audio in the project.

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    The code of this project was absolute spaghetti. Due to my unfamiliarity with organising data structures, I attempted a 
                    variety of efforts to produce rpg elements such as stats, items, and spells. Most of this was done using grid data structures
                    and a complicated hard coded indexing system. The movement system alone took over a month to figure out. It relies on Gamemaker's 
                    built-in map planning system to calculate the distance of each tile from the player. However, due to percularities in how the 
                    system is implemented, I was unable to add terrain effects, such as mud to slow movement, as the system would not identify shorter routes
                    about these hazards. Despite the difficulties encountered during this project, the lessons learnt contributed to my next RPG project.
