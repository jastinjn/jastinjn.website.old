                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    This demo reimagines the first dungeon of Atlus's <i>Persona 4</i> as an 8-bit first person dungeon crawler RPG in the style of the company's 
                    original Megami Tensei franchise for the NES. Players explore a randomly generated labyrinth, fighting off random encounters of shadows. 
                    During battles, the player can use elemental weaknesses to their strength to knock down enemies, just as in the original PS2 titles. 
                    The protagonist and Yosuke Hanamura appear as playable characters with respective personas Izanagi and Jiraiya.
                    The game concludes with the boss fight against Shadow Chie.

                <h3>Art and Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    The style of this game was greatly inspired by Megami Tensei II on the NES. All sprites and visual effects are 100% original. 
                    Admittedly, the sprites are not as polished as they could be, as the focus of this project was programming the game's mechanics.
                    The resolution of the screen is small, meant to copy the size of the Game Boy Color. In addition, all sprites have a maximum of 5
                    unique colors (with exceptions), which was the color limitation of the system. I enjoyed creating the 8-bit portrait sprites of 
                    the characters and enemies the most during this progress. 
                </p>

                    For music and audio effects, I used resources found online. All SFX used in this game are taken from the NES Megami Tensei games. For music, I found a collection
                    of 8-bit versions of the Persona 4 ost and implemented them into the project.

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    As this was the first project I had undertaken after taking a programming class, the code is much nicer compared to my previous two projects.
                    This project makes great use of the new additions to the gamemaker language that came with update 2.3, namely updated arrays, functions, and the newly addedstructs.
                    I also made heavy use of map data structures to store data for game elements such as enemies, abilities and equipment, unlike my previous project which used grids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of each floor, an algorithm using Gamemaker's built-in map planning functions randomly generates the floor layout. To achieve the pseudo 3-dimensional view,
                    a set of 2D sprites are scaled and position appropriately based on the position of map elements relative to the players position and direction. A minimap is also displayed,
                    rendering nearby map elements to the bottom right corner of the GUI. The minimap was especially difficult to implement due to some oddities of the dungeon generator. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All playable characters and their attributes (health, stats, equipment) as well as enemy shadows exist as structs of data. At the start of random encounters, a controller retrieves this data,
                    creates instances of each enemy and places them based on their turn over. A basic enemy AI system is used, which can be set to change enemy behaviour.
                </p>
